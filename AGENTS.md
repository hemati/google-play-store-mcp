# Repository Guidelines

These instructions apply to all files in this repository.

- Use Google-style docstrings for modules and functions, including **Args** and
  **Returns** sections where applicable.
- Keep docstrings concise yet descriptive so tools and clients understand the
  behavior of each function.
- After modifying code, run the test suite with `pytest` to verify that the
  project remains stable.
